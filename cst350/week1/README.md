## Part 3: What I learned

> I believe I learned a lot as so far I have only developed websites using javascript/typescript frameworks. I prefer to code in C# so this has been a really interesting lesson. I love how simple it is to incorporate code into HTML using @{} whereas a framework like Angular feels more abstract. Key concepts would mainly be showing how these pages can show data and how that data can be altered.

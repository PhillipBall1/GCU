```Screenshots of SQL queries and three INSERT order item queries. ```

> I created a bunch of orders and just made them random for certain inputs so I could just spam create them. This joining the orders later look better due to an increased number of order_items

```Screenshots of the SQL SELECT query and results that show all items associated with a single order.```

**Write a one-paragraph summary of the key concepts that were demonstrated in this lesson**

>I believe that we learned how to connect data to a mongoDB and then to a functional application. These steps were similar to the SQL version that we did in week 5, but using mongoDB seems to be much more efficient as an upside. The key concepts were mainly creating the components to make the connections between the database and application.

## Screen Shots

**Proof of tutorial completion**

![tutorial](docs/tutorial.png)

**Select statement to join (union) two sets of user data. Select all users whose last name contains "Smith." Select all users whose last name contains "Hayes." Return the names in a single result.**

![1](docs/1.png)

**SQL statement to select all columns from the customers table. Exclude all customers who conducted a sale after August 1, 2021.**

![2](docs/2.png)

**SQL statement to select sale_id and sale_total_amt from the sale table. Calculate a 10% tax on each sale. Calculate a 12-month interest free payment plan for the total bill.**

![3](docs/3.png)

**Show that a select statement uses a "Full Table Scan" when no index is present.**

![4](docs/4.png)

**Show that the same select statement achieves a more efficient result when an index is applied.**

**Take a screenshot of the results of a WHERE clause used in a SELECT statement.**

**Take a screenshot of the results of a WHERE clause used to find a partial string match in a column.**

## Research

```Write a one-paragraph summary of the key concepts that were demonstrated in this lesson```

>The first part of this lesson demonstrated statements that were able to 1, combine to sets using a union to get both last names of 'Smith' and 'Hayes', 2, Exclude unwanted information by setting a particular date, and 3, where we selected an ID, original_amt, total + tax, monthly_pay and calculated a total with tax and a monthly payment. In the second part, we learned different variations on the WHERE clause and  scenarios to use them. Lastly we created a GUI for the music database using WinFormsApp. We learned how to create a DAO to control the querying commands and received data from those commands to be displayed on an application.

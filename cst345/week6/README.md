## Research 

**Write a one-paragraph summary of the key concepts that were demonstrated in this lesson.**

>The key concepts that we learned in this lesson were how to connect to a mongo database. This included replacing our previous SQL database and fixing our visual studio code to implement the new mongo database functionality. Personally, I learned that the workflow of mongo database is much faster than MySQL.
